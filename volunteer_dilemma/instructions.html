        Instructions
    </h3>

    <p>
        You will be grouped randomly and anonymously in a group of
        {{ session.config.players_per_group }}
        participants.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each of you decides independently and simultaneously whether you will
        volunteer or not. If at least one of you volunteers, everyone will get
        {{ Constants.general_benefit }}. However, the volunteer(s) will
        pay {{ Constants.volunteer_cost }}. If no one
        volunteers, everyone receives nothing.
